      "summary": "It's March 2020, and like the rest of the planet my little life took a hit by the coronovirus outbreak, being self employed, meant I was home, with plenty of time to fill. The question was what to do with all this time, I live by the beach in Antalya, Turkey so I could swim everyday, I could set out on that fitness regime I'd been telling my wife I would start. Maybe, get around to finally doing all the odd jobs around my home I'd been promising.<br /><div><br /></div><div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\">So, with all that in mind on the first day, I woke, poured myself a coffee turned on the radio and looked at my bookcase and the bible for all Glovers fans the excellent 'Hendford to Huish Park'&nbsp; by Kerry Miller was staring at me. I'd read it before when it first came out in 1999. So, it seemed a perfect opportunity to read again.</div><br />I'd forgotten what a good read it was, matches and players&nbsp; long forgotten in the clubs rich history. Something stirred me inside, as much as it is an excellent read, I wanted to know more of the matches, the stories behind them and most of all the characters that are all engrained into the DNA of Yeovil Town Football club.<br /><br />So, with all this in mind, I subscribed to the British Newspaper archive to try and get some more information on these characters. Also, using resources already online, Bob Osborn's amazingly Yeovil History website. I searched high and low for photos, anything connected to Yeovil town, and of course match reports. Reports going back to even before the Yeovil Casuals were formed in 1895. Also,various Yeovil Web pages including&nbsp; the outstanding Yeovil Town a pictorial history Facebook page.<br /><br />My discoveries didn't disappoint me, eye-opening tales of great matches, great players and their lives and background. It also hit me, that without the excellent way, the club was run, especially in its early days then like many clubs at that time, Yeovil Casuals would have not lasted long, and us, the fans 125 years later would not have a club to support.<br /><br />So, I hope you enjoy these pages, I hope that fans, especially the younger ones will read and realise what an incredible club Yeovil Town is, and what incredible stories and people have left their footprints on our&nbsp; history.<br /><br />Happy days.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div>"

In fact I have only face to face met a handful of other collectors in over a decade.</span><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family: &quot;times&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;\"></span></div></div><div style=\"line-height: 18px;\"><div style=\"text-align: right;\"></div><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aR--FSEPFTw/XWUiVvhgUwI/AAAAAAAACa8/xzoG5LYdQzYxYd8aaiFFg6KsANHJsOT7wCLcBGAs/s1600/1930%2527s%2BRand%2BMcNally%2Bpair.JPG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1097\" data-original-width=\"1600\" height=\"219\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aR--FSEPFTw/XWUiVvhgUwI/AAAAAAAACa8/xzoG5LYdQzYxYd8aaiFFg6KsANHJsOT7wCLcBGAs/s320/1930%2527s%2BRand%2BMcNally%2Bpair.JPG\" width=\"320\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">1930 Rand McNally globe pair&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family: &quot;times&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So as I sit and write I think if there are only 50 people around who seriously collect globes than why blog at all. Well I'll answer my own question ( I'll probably do that a lot) I think globe collecting is in it's infancy. It is certainly not popular like some collecting genres. I think there are a lot of reasons for this there certainly are barriers to entry, old globes are hard to find, most antique dealers have none, in fact I visit a huge antique mall in Rochester NY fairly often and I see few if any globes and the few I see are either too beat up or too new to interest me. They take up a lot of space, after you buy your 3rd globe you will realize one of 2 things either &nbsp;1. I need to change my decorating to include globes, or &nbsp;2. I need to devote a whole room to my collection; many people will do neither of these things and will not pursue the hobby.</span></div><div style=\"line-height: 18px;\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family: &quot;times&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So then why collect globes? &nbsp;For me the answer is as simple as Art , Science, and History. &nbsp;I love all three to varying degrees and an old globe has the potential to offer all three. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-family: &quot;times&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;\">&nbsp;Antique globes were created at a time and with materials that are just not as commonly used today. Wood, plaster, brass, paper. &nbsp;Common materials employed for their durability, built to last. &nbsp;Craftsmanship that has stood the test of time.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style=\"font-family: &quot;times&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As a collector my goal is to assemble a representative collection that spans a century and a half of globe production in America from 1811 until about 1950. &nbsp;Won't you join me on this quest, read on and we can learn from each other. &nbsp;Scroll through my posts, 120 and counting, 5 years worth, they start with the most recent and keep reading, and exploring!&nbsp;</span><br /><span style=\"font-family: &quot;times&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Just two rules............1. don't be afraid to contact me, either in post, or via email, and 2.
